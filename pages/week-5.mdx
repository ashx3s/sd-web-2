# Week 5: Interactivity with Forms

## Expectations

- Read and do the activities for [Interactivity with Forms](/week-5/interactivity-with-forms)
- Attend class and participate in the review of this week's content
- Start working on [Week 5 Assignment](/week-5/assignment)

## Lab Activity: State and Events Challenge Set

These are a set of functionalities that are very useful to practice programming with state and events in react. Today's lab will be mostly a solo activity (though you're encouraged to discuss and collaborate when it's helpful to you). After about an hour and a half I will ask that members of the class volunteer to demonstrate their solutions to **1** of each of the challenges (students will be picked if there are not enough volunteers).

### 1. Setup

- Copy the contents of the [starter.js]() file into a new route in your **practice** repo.
- (optional) split the data arrays out into a `data.js` file

### 2. Review Problems and Pseudocode

- There are a set of requirements to be implemented that go from easy to challenging (more or less)
- Consider the technical requirements of each problem and outline how you might want to solve them
- _(optional) if it suites you better, work through them 1 at a time from start to finish_

### 3. Implement solution(s)

- Start with the approach that you outlined in your pseudocode
- Consider what values need to be stored in state and what the events need to return / affect
- Refer to [Ashlyn's Cheat Sheet](https://hackmd.io/@ashx3s/H1k9VoCLZl) as needed
- Use console.log and alert to test what's happening when things don't work

### 4. Outline an explanation of your code

- Do this for at least **1** of the problems.
- Imagine that you needed to explain the code to a colleague or someone asking for help

#### Useful Questions to Frame your Explanation

- What problem were you solving and what was the expected behavior?
- Which React concepts did you use (state, event handlers, conditional rendering, etc.) and why?
- Walk through the key parts of your code - what happens when the user interacts with it?
- What was tricky and how did you work through it?
- What alternative approaches could work here, and what are the tradeoffs?

### 5. Class Presentations

- Working from simpler to more complex, volunteers & selected students will walk the class through their code
- Students observing are encouraged to ask questions

## Lab Assignment

The rest of the class will be allocated to working on the weekly assignment.
