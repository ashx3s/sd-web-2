## NextJS Framework Review 45 min

**Goal**: Whiteboard a model of the use cases for the directories in a NextJS project

- In small groups, create an online whiteboard and invite everyone to collaborate
- Go to the [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure) for your data source
- Create a sticky for each of the directories with the title and basic description (as seen on the doc page linked)
- Connect subsequent stickies that address:
  - details of what the basic description means
  - examples of what that would be used for
  - a link to the nextjs documentation page that shows how to work with the feature of the feature
  - a note on what problem this solves (ie: if you weren't using next, how might you need to implement the feature)

## Debrief

- After about 30 min, we'll go around the room and groups will walk through what they learned in one of their sticky trees
