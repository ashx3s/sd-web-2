# Week 6 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, we will combine the components we built in Weeks 4 and 5 to create a functional "Shopping List" application.

You will learn how to Lift State Up to a parent component so that sibling components (the form and the list) can communicate. You will also implement the sorting functionality within the list.

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

### Part 1: Initial Setup

- Link to the Week 6 Page
- Edit the project file `/app/page.js` and add a link to week-6.
- Create the Folder and Files
- Copy Files from past weeks as necesary
- Your naming conventions might be different (kebab-case filenames will work though PascalCase is preffered)
  - Copy items.json, Item.js, and ItemList.js from your Week 4 folder.
  - Create Page:
  - Create a new page.js file inside /app/week-6.
  - Copy NewItem.js from your Week 5 folder to your Week 6 folder.

## Part 2: Refactoring Components

- We need to modify our existing components to handle data flowing between them.
- Update Item Component
  - No changes needed. It should still accept name, quantity, and category as props.
- Update NewItem Component
- We need to modify the form so that instead of just alerting the user, it sends the new item data up to the parent component.
  - Props: Update the NewItem component function definition to accept props (or destructure `{ onAddItem }`).
  - Handle Submit: Inside your handleSubmit function:
  - Generate a random id for the new item (you can use Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 9) or the web API crypto.randomUUID()).
  - Create the item object with id, name, quantity, and category.
  - Call the Prop: Instead of alert(), call the function passed as a prop: onAddItem(item).
  - Keep the state reset logic (clearing the form after submission).
- Update ItemList Component
- We need to remove the hardcoded data from this component so it can accept the list from the parent.
  - Props: Update the ItemList component to accept the items prop.
  - Remove Data Import: Remove the import line for items.json. The data will now come from the props.
  - State for Sorting:
    - Import useState from React.
  - Initialize a state variable sortBy (default to "name").
  - Sorting Logic:
    - Create a sorted version of the items prop based on the sortBy state.
    - Note: Do not mutate the original prop. Use [...items].sort(...).
    - Sort by name or category depending on the state variable.
  - Sort Buttons:
    - Render two buttons to toggle the sortBy state between "name" and "category".
    - Style the active button to look different (e.g., darker background).
  - Render:
    - Map over the sorted items variable (not the prop directly) to render your Item components.

### Part 3: Building the App in Page

Now we will wire everything together in the Page component. This component will hold the "Master State" of the list.

- Imports
  - In /app/week-6/page.js:
    - Import Item (if needed), ItemList, and NewItem.
    - Import itemsData from `./items.json`
    - Import useState from React.
- Initialize State
  - Initialize a state variable named items with the data imported from items.json.
- Create Event Handler
  - Create a function called handleAddItem that takes newItem as an argument.
  - This function should update the items state by adding the newItem to the existing array. (Remember to spread the previous state: setItems([...items, newItem])).
- Render
  - Return a main element containing:
    - An h1 header "Shopping List".
    - The NewItem component.
    - Pass your handleAddItem function to the onAddItem prop.
    - The ItemList component.
    - Pass your items state variable to the items prop.

### Part 4: Optional Extra Challenge

- Update the sorting in ItemList to support a "Group by Category" feature.
  - Add a third button "Group by Category".
  - If selected, the render method should group items by category headers, sorting both the categories and the items within them alphabetically.

Example Output:

```
**Bakery**

    bread 🍞

**Dairy**

    eggs, dozen 🥚
    milk, 4 L 🥛
```
