## Follow up Practice Tasks

Depending on what kinds of challenges your having. Consider doing at least 1 of the following:

- Create a new next project in github for Proof of Concept practice
  - ie: making small alternate examples of the code used in our labs
- Use JsFiddle to practice javascript
  - for things like array methods and working with data structures without the overhead of a framework
- Brainstorm on other small test cases to implement with AI or by reviewing common tutorial examples
  - instead of doing a tutorial, or copying ai gen code, take a particular concept or piece of syntax and come up with a small test case
  - then using either jsfiddle or a demo repo, build out a mini example
  - follow up by debriefing the code and make notes on your understanding
- Pair code with a colleague on any of the above tasks
  - Actually pair code, especially if you don't feel confident
