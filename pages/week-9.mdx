## Context API Practice Starter Repos

These are based on the demonstrations that I've done in class and lab. They have some of the code filled out (particularly code that's not essential to the context api and that we've covered in previous weeks).

- [Context API Basics Local User Login Toggle](https://github.com/ashx3s/context-api-tutorial-starter)
- [Firebase Auth Context API](https://github.com/ashx3s/firebase-tutorial-starter-code)
- [Color Mode Theme Toggle](https://github.com/ashx3s/context-api-theme-toggle-starter-code)

## Follow up Practice Tasks

Depending on what kinds of challenges your having. Consider doing at least 1 of the following:

- Create a new next project in github for Proof of Concept practice
  - ie: making small alternate examples of the code used in our labs
- Use JsFiddle to practice javascript
  - for things like array methods and working with data structures without the overhead of a framework
- Brainstorm on other small test cases to implement with AI or by reviewing common tutorial examples
  - instead of doing a tutorial, or copying ai gen code, take a particular concept or piece of syntax and come up with a small test case
  - then using either jsfiddle or a demo repo, build out a mini example
  - follow up by debriefing the code and make notes on your understanding
- Pair code with a colleague on any of the above tasks
  - Actually pair code, especially if you don't feel confident
