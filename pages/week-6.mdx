## Lab Practice Activity

This pair coding activity is designed to help you develop your react and tailwind skills along with git skills. Specifically you'll be building list components like what was demoed but you'll also have opportunities to explore styling and experimenting with different code patterns.

- 1 team member needs to [fork this repo](https://github.com/ashx3s/cprg-306-pair-code-list-activity)
- Then add the other team members as collaborators to the repo
- After this, each person should clone the forked repo down so they can work on the code
- Review [the pair programming instructional video](https://youtu.be/vgkahOzFH2Q?si=95Uqm49uZVz1Sz-J) for a quick overview on how to work in a pair code formation
- Like your graded assignments, this activity is flexibile in how you implement the styles. Find a style spec from a design system like Material or Carbon to emulate. and also choose typography, colors, and images that have a consistent style
- For good design tips, refer to the [Visual Hierarchy Video](https://youtu.be/qZWDJqY27bw?si=tofwxc_zEiiF0GJ5) and subsequent videos on typography, alignment, and use of space
