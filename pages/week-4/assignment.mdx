# Week 4 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, we will focus on rendering lists in React. You will learn how to load static data from a JSON file and render it dynamically using the JavaScript `.map()` method. The goal is to become proficient in breaking down your UI into small, reusable components and passing data via props.


## Part 1: Initial Setup

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Link to the Week 4 Page

Edit the project file `/app/page.js` (the landing page) and add a link to `week-4` in the list of links.

### Create the Folder and Files

Create the folder `/app/week-4` and the files `page.js`, `item-list.js`, `item.js`, and `items.json` inside it.

### `items.json`

This file contains the data for the shopping list. It is an array of objects, where each object represents an item in the list.

Copy the following data into `/app/week-4/items.json`:

```json copy
[
  {
    "id": "1h2GJKH12gkHG31h1H",
    "name": "milk, 4 L 🥛",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "dairy"
  },
  {
    "id": "2KJH3k2j3H1k2J3K1H",
    "name": "bread 🍞",
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "bakery"
  },
  {
    "id": "3h2KJH3k2j3H1k2J3",
    "name": "eggs, dozen 🥚",
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "dairy"
  },
  {
    "id": "4k2J3K1H2GJKH12gk",
    "name": "bananas 🍌",
    "quantity": 6,
    "category": "produce"
  },
  {
    "id": "5H1h1H2KJH3k2j3H",
    "name": "broccoli 🥦",
    "quantity": 3,
    "category": "produce"
  },
  {
    "id": "6H1k2J3K1H2GJKH1",
    "name": "chicken breasts, 1 kg 🍗",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "meat"
  },
  {
    "id": "7gkHG31h1H2KJH3k",
    "name": "pasta sauce 🍝",
    "quantity": 3,
    "category": "canned goods"
  },
  {
    "id": "8j3H1k2J3K1H2GJK",
    "name": "spaghetti, 454 g 🍝",
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "dry goods"
  },
  {
    "id": "9H12gkHG31h1H2KJ",
    "name": "toilet paper, 12 pack 🧻",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "household"
  },
  {
    "id": "10H3k2j3H1k2J3K1",
    "name": "paper towels, 6 pack",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "household"
  },
  {
    "id": "11k2J3K1H2GJKH12",
    "name": "dish soap 🍽️",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "household"
  },
  {
    "id": "12GJKH12gkHG31h1",
    "name": "hand soap 🧼",
    "quantity": 4,
    "category": "household"
  }
]

```

</Steps>

## Part 2: The Components

<Steps>

### Build the `Item` Component

In `item.js`, create a functional component named `Item`.

This component must accept `name`, `quantity`, and `category` as **props**. It should render these details in a list item (`<li>`) element, styled with Tailwind CSS to look organized (e.g., using a card-like appearance).

**Tip:** Ensure you are destructuring the props in the function arguments or accessing them via a `props` object.

### Build the `ItemList` Component

In `item-list.js`, create a functional component named `ItemList`.

1. **Imports:** Import the `Item` component you just created and the data from `items.json`.
2. **Mapping:** Inside the component, use the JavaScript `map` function to loop through the `items` array.
3. **Rendering:** For each item in the array, return an `Item` component.
4. **Props:** Pass the `name`, `quantity`, and `category` from the data object to the `Item` component as props.
5. **Keys:** Don't forget to provide a unique `key` prop for each component using the item's `id`.

**Requirements:**

* Do not use `useState` or any state management.
* Do not include any buttons or event handlers.
* Focus strictly on ensuring data flows correctly from the JSON file -> `ItemList` -> `Item`.

### Build the `Page` Component

In `page.js`, create a functional component named `Page`.

It should return a `main` element wrapped around an `h1` header ("Shopping List") and the `ItemList` component. Since `ItemList` is handling the data internally (loading the JSON), you do not need to pass props to `ItemList` at this stage.

</Steps>

### Optional Extra Challenge

Right now, the list renders in the order provided by the JSON file.

Without using state or buttons, try to render the list **grouped by category**. The result should look like this:

<div className="border p-3">
**Bakery**

* bread 🍞

**Canned Goods**

* pasta sauce 🍝

**Dairy**

* eggs, dozen 🥚
* milk, 4 L 🥛

...etc

</div>

**Hint:** You can achieve this by manipulating the data *before* you map it. You might use the `.reduce()` method or multiple `.filter()` calls to organize the items into categories, and then map over those categories.
