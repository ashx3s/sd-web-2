## Lab Activity: Bughunt Planning 30 minutes

This is a pair code brainstorming activity

### Setup
- Organize yourselves into groups of 2-3
- Everyone will [download the starter code](https://github.com/ashx3s/sd-web-2-a1-starter) for assignment 1
- Review the instructions and identify objectives that are unclear or reference unknown terms
- Either create a tasks.md file or Tasks heading (or something similar) to the README

### Activity
- Walk through the code together and identify bugs, issues, or incomplete code
  - Visually review using liveserver extension
  - Step through the code, 1 file at a time
  - **take notes on what's wrong and why**
    - If you see a clear quick fix, write it down for later
- Collaboratively Review the javascript file
  - consider what is required for each objective (outcome)
    - write this down in your markdown file
    - document terms, functionalities, or anything that will require research
  - in the js file, use comments to plan out how you would implement the functionality
  - **Your approach will be written and determined individually, however it should be informed by your discussion with one another**
- Upon completion, you've now created an action plan for assignment 1

### Outcome
- A set of notes that you can use as or convert to a checklist
- Clear objectives for the functionality written in your own terms
- Logic planning for the javascript functionality
