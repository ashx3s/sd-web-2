# Week 4: Handling Lists

## Expectations

- **UPDATED for this Semester**: Please complete Ashlyn's [Web Dev Instructor & Class Review Survey](https://forms.office.com/r/Fai42fkZ32)
- Attend class and participate in the review of this week's content
- Start working on [Week 4 Assignment](/week-4/assignment)

### [Code Example](https://github.com/ashx3s/cprg306-demos/blob/main/app/week-4/page.js)

### Slides

import Slideshow from "/components/Slideshow";

<Slideshow file="/week-4/slides" />

## Lab Activity

You'll revisit your practice repos from the previous activity, working in pairs to create a new page that displays a collection of items using React components and the map() method.

### Part 1: Planning & Data Setup (20 minutes)

#### Step 1: Form Pairs & Choose Working Structure

Option A (Preferred): Partner with **one** person from your previous group

Review each other's existing repos
Decide whose repo you'll work in for this lab
Work together on one project

Option B (If needed): If pairing from your previous group doesn't work

Partner with someone outside your group
Each person works in their own repo
Collaborate on patterns and approaches, but develop your own content

#### Step 2: Identify Your Collection

Based on your site's topic, choose something that can be represented as a collection of similar items.
Examples:

Sports site → Teams in a league, players on a roster, games in a season
Music site → Albums, artists, playlists, songs
Gaming site → Game titles, characters, achievements
Food site → Recipes, restaurants, ingredients

#### Step 3: Create Your Data File

Create a new directory to for the page route (and data)
Inside, create either items.js or items.json
Build a collection of 3-12 items with consistent properties

Each item should have 3-5 properties minimum:
javascript// Example: data/teams.js

```js
export const teams = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Thunder Bears",
    city: "Portland",
    wins: 42,
    image: "/placeholder.jpg",
  },
  // ... 2-11 more items
];
```

**Tips:**

- Use the same placeholder image for all items initially
- You can use AI to help generate realistic content
- Keep properties consistent across all items

### Part 2: Build Your Components (50 minutes)

#### Step 4: Create Your Page File

Create a new page file (e.g., teams.jsx, gallery.jsx, etc.)
Import your data at the top
Set up the basic page structure

#### Step 5: Plan Your Component Structure

Minimum requirement: 2 components + the page
Think about separation of concerns:

- What should be a reusable component?
- What logic belongs in each component?
- How will data flow through props?

Example structure:

Page component (contains the collection)
Card/Item component (receives individual item via props)
Optional: Header, Container, or other layout components

#### Step 6: Choose Your Layout

- Pick ONE of these layout patterns using Tailwind CSS:
  - Option A: Horizontal Scroll Section
  - Option B: Three-Card Flex Layout
  - Option C: Grid Gallery

#### Step 7: Implement Map Iteration

Use the map() method to iterate over your collection and render components:

**Remember:**

- Always include a unique key prop
- Pass data through props to child components
- Keep your component logic focused and reusable

#### Step 8: Style with Tailwind

- Apply Tailwind classes to match your chosen layout
- Ensure responsive design (consider mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Keep styling consistent across components

### Part 3: Testing & Refinement (20 minutes)

- Test your page in the browser
- Verify all items render correctly
- Check responsive behavior at different screen sizes
- Ensure components receive and display props properly
- Clean up any console errors or warnings

### Debrief

After we'll have a class discussion

- How did you decide what should be a separate component versus keeping logic in the page? Walk us through your reasoning.
- What challenges did you face when determining component boundaries? Would you restructure anything now?
- Did you create more than the minimum 2 components? Why or why not?
- How did you decide what data to pass as props? Did you pass the entire object or individual properties?
- Which layout option did you choose and why? How did Tailwind make this easier or harder?
- If you were to add one new feature to your collection page, what would it be and how would you implement it?
