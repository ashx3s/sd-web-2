# Week 5 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, we will learn the basics of **State** and **Event Handling** in React by creating a "Controlled Component." You will build a form that allows users to create a new shopping list item.

For now, this form will not add the item to the list we built in Week 4. Instead, we will focus on successfully capturing the user's input and displaying it in an alert.

## Part 1: Initial Setup

<Steps>

### Link to the Week 5 Page

Edit the project file `/app/page.js` and add a link to `week-5`.

### Create the Folder and Files

Create the folder `/app/week-5`.
Create a file named `page.js` and a file named `new-item.js` inside it.

</Steps>

## Part 2: The `NewItem` Component

<Steps>

### Setup the Component

In `new-item.js`, create a functional component named `NewItem`.
Since this component will use interactivity (hooks), you must add the `"use client"` directive at the very top of the file.

### Initialize State

Import `useState` from React.
Create three state variables to manage the form inputs:

1. `name`: Initialize as an empty string `""`.
2. `quantity`: Initialize as `1`.
3. `category`: Initialize as `"produce"`.

### Create the Form UI

The component should return a form with the following fields. Use Tailwind CSS to style the form so it is clean and accessible (e.g., max-width, background color, padding).

1. **Name Field:**
* An `<input>` of type `text`.
* Set the `value` prop to your `name` state variable.
* Use the `onChange` event to update the `name` state.
* Set `required` to true.
* *Style tip:* Use `w-full`, `p-2`, and `rounded-md`.


2. **Quantity and Category Row:**
* Group these two fields in a flex container so they sit side-by-side.
* **Quantity Field:**
* An `<input>` of type `number`.
* Min: 1, Max: 99.
* Set the `value` to your `quantity` state.
* Update state on change.


* **Category Field:**
* A `<select>` element.
* Set the `value` to your `category` state.
* Update state on change.
* **Options:** Create `<option>` tags for: Produce, Dairy, Bakery, Meat, Frozen Foods, Canned Goods, Dry Goods, Beverages, Snacks, Household, Other.




3. **Submit Button:**
* A `<button>` of type `submit`.
* Label it "+".
* Style it to look clickable (e.g., blue background, white text, hover effects).



### Handle the Form Submission

Create a function named `handleSubmit` inside your component.

1. **Prevent Default:** Call `event.preventDefault()` so the page doesn't reload.
2. **Create Object:** Create an `item` object with the current `name`, `quantity`, and `category`.
3. **Log the Item:** `console.log` the item object to the console.
4. **User Feedback:** Call `alert()` to display the details of the created item (e.g., "Added: Bread, quantity: 2, category: bakery").
5. **Reset State:** Reset `name` to `""`, `quantity` to `1`, and `category` to `"produce"`.

Connect this function to the `onSubmit` prop of your `<form>` element.

</Steps>

## Part 3: The Page Component

<Steps>

### Render the Form

In `/app/week-5/page.js`:

1. Import the `NewItem` component.
2. Create a functional component named `Page`.
3. Render the `NewItem` component inside a customized `<main>` layout (e.g., centered on the screen with a dark background).

</Steps>

## Part 4: Assignment Submission

* Submit the links to your github repo and deployed site
