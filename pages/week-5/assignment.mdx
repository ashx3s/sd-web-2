# Week 5 Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, we will learn the basics of State and Event Handling in React by creating a "Controlled Component." You will build a form that allows users to create a new shopping list item.

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

### Part 1: Initial Setup

- Link to the Week 5 Page
- Edit the project file `/app/page.js` and add a link to week-5.
- Create the Folder and Files
- Create the folder /app/week-5.
- Create a file named `page.js` and a file named `NewItem.js` inside it.

### Part 2: The NewItem Component

- Setup the Component
- In NewItem.js, create a functional component named NewItem.
  Since this component will use interactivity (hooks), you must add the "use client" directive at the very top of the file.
- Initialize State
- Import useState from React.
- Create three state variables to manage the form inputs:
  - name: Initialize as an empty string "".
  - quantity: Initialize as 1.
  - category: Initialize as "produce".

- **Create the Form UI**
- The component should return a form with the following fields. Use Tailwind CSS to style the form so it is clean and accessible (e.g., max-width, background color, padding).
- Name Field:
  - An input of type text.
  - Set the value prop to your name state variable.
  - Use the onChange event to update the name state.
  - Set required to true.
  - Style tip: Use w-full, p-2, and rounded-md.
- Quantity and Category Row:
  - Group these two fields in a flex container so they sit side-by-side.
  - Quantity Field:
  - An input of type number.
  - Min: 1, Max: 99.
  - Set the value to your quantity state.
  - Update state on change.
- Category Field:
  - A select element.
  - Set the value to your category state.
  - Update state on change.
  - Options: Create option tags for: Produce, Dairy, Bakery, Meat, Frozen Foods, Canned Goods, Dry Goods, Beverages, Snacks, Household, Other.
- Submit Button:
  - A button of type submit.
  - Label it "+".
  - Style it to look clickable (e.g., blue background, white text, hover effects).
- Handle the Form Submission
  - Create a function named handleSubmit inside your component.
    - Prevent Default: Call event.preventDefault() so the page doesn't reload.
    - Create Object: Create an item object with the current name, quantity, and category.
    - Log the Item: console.log the item object to the console.
    - User Feedback: Call alert() to display the details of the created item (e.g., "Added: Bread, quantity: 2, category: bakery").
    - Reset State: Reset name to "", quantity to 1, and category to "produce".
  - Connect this function to the onSubmit prop of your form element.

### Part 3: The Page Component

- Render the Form
  - In /app/week-5/page.js:
    - Import the NewItem component.
    - Create a functional component named Page.
    - Render the NewItem component inside a customized main layout (e.g., centered on the screen with a dark background).

### Part 4: Assignment Submission

- Submit the links to your github repo and deployed site
