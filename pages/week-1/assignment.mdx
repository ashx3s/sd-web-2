# Week 1 Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to ensure that you have the correct working development environment for the course and have access to the code demos.

## Part 1: Development Environment Setup

Follow and complete this guide to setup your development environment for the course: [Guide: Development Environment Setup](/guides-and-references/development-environment-setup.mdx)

- indentation spaces to 2 for js, html, and css
- set up [github ssh keys for repo security](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
  - you can use github desktop or git on the command line (demos in class will all be done command line)
  - this is important because it allows secure passwordless connection between your computer and github **this is an industry standard setup that you'll be expected to understand for many jobs**
- install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - it's set up correctly if you can type `node` into your command line and get a node prompt that looks similar to this (the version might be different and that's ok)
    - ```js
    Welcome to Node.js v22.15.0.
    Type ".help" for more information.
    >
    ```

## Part 2: Accessing the Broken Code

Let's test your development environment setup by forking a javascript, html, css project to debug the errors in it.
- Fork this repository and then clone your version down to your computer
- [Code Repository](https://github.com/ashx3s/sd-web-2-community-events)
- There are logic and syntax errors in all of the files that need to be fixed
  - there isn't necessarily a single solution for each problem, what I'm looking for is code that runs when using the [live server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  - the console should not throw any errors
  - html should render and demonstrate semantic syntax usage
- in the `README.md` file make a brief comment on what the differences between forking, cloning, and downloading are.
- add a `.gitignore` file with `node_modules` added. (_while most frameworks will generate this for you, it's important to understand the relevance of this file and know to look for it_)

## Part 3: Assignment Submission

In your section of the CPRG 306 course in Brightspace, Submit the following into the week 1 assignment page.
- A link to your github repository (in the submission comment)
- A .zip directory of your project (create from Github or your computer)
  - verify that you are not also zipping the node_modules directory.

## Rubric 10 points (weighted 5% of your final grade)
_the following indicate what I'm looking for when I grade_

### Code Quality /5
- resolution of bugs
- code organization (indentation, formatting etc)
- variable naming conventions and casing

### Code Management /5
- Git commits (at least 2 with meaningful commit messages)
- Repo is up to date with .zip
- README terminology note
