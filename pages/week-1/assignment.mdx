# Week 1 Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to ensure that you have the correct working development environment for the course and have access to the code demos.

## Part 1: Development Environment Setup

Follow and complete this guide to setup your development environment for the course: [Guide: Development Environment Setup](/guides-and-references/development-environment-setup.mdx)

- indentation spaces to 2 for js, html, and css
- set up [github ssh keys for repo security](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) (if you already haven't)
  - you can use github desktop or git on the command line (demos in class will all be done command line)
  - this is important because it allows secure passwordless connection between your computer and github **this is an industry standard setup that you'll be expected to understand for many jobs**
- install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

  - it's set up correctly if you can type `node` into your command line and get a node prompt that looks similar to this:
    - ```js
      Welcome to Node.js v22.15.0.
      Type ".help" for more information.
      >_
      ```
  - stick to **LTS** versions for Long Term Support and stable version features.

### **Main Task**

capture screenshot of node working on your command line.

- demonstrate with `console.log("Hello from 'your name'")`
- add the image to your project in the appropriately named directory

## Part 2: Accessing & Fix the Broken Code

Let's test your development environment setup by forking a javascript, html, css project to debug the errors in it.

- Fork this repository and then clone your version down to your computer
- [Code Repository](https://github.com/ashx3s/)
- There are logic and syntax errors in all of the files that need to be fixed
  - there isn't necessarily a single solution for each problem
  - the console should not throw any errors
  - html should render and demonstrate semantic syntax usage
  - css should be responsive and demonstrate accessible ui design
- in the `README.md` file make a brief comment on what the differences between forking, cloning, and downloading are.
- add a `.gitignore` file with `node_modules` added. (_while most frameworks will generate this for you, it's important to understand the relevance of this file and know to look for it_)

### Main Task

- Fix the html, css, and js
- Outline your understanding of important git terms

## Part 3: Assignment Submission

In your section of the CPRG 306 course in Brightspace, Submit the following into the week 1 assignment page.

- A link to your github repository (in the submission comment)
- A Github Pages link to the live site (also in comments)
- A .zip directory of your project (create from Github or your computer)

### Main Task

- Validate before submission
- Make sure the code runs effectively
- Submit links and codebase

## Rubric 10 points (weighted 5% of your final grade)

### Code Quality /5

- effective bug fixes
- code organization (indentation, formatting etc)
- JS: clear variable names, conventions, and casing
- CSS: functioning responsive design, accessible colour, effective use of visual hierarchy
- HTML: Semantic html tags are used. W3C validation pass

### Code Management /5

- Git commits (at least 2 with meaningful commit messages)
- Repo is up to date with .zip
- README terminology notes
- Node CLI screenshot
