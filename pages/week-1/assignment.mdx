# Week 1 Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to ensure that you have the correct working development environment for the course and have access to the code demos.

---

## Part 1: Development Environment Setup

Follow the [Development Environment Setup Guide](/guides-and-references/development-environment-setup.mdx) to configure your machine for this course.

- Set indentation to **2 spaces** for JS, HTML, and CSS.
- Set up [GitHub SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) if you haven't already.
  - SSH keys provide a secure, passwordless connection to GitHub and are an **industry standard**.
- Install the **LTS** version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
  - To verify it's working, type `node` in your command line to open the Node.js prompt.

### **Main Task: Screenshot Verification**

- Capture a screenshot of the Node.js prompt on your command line after running the following command:
  - `console.log("Hello from 'your name'")`
- Create a directory in your project for static assets (e.g., `public/` or `assets/`) and add your screenshot to it.

## Part 2: Accessing & Fixing the Broken Code

Let's test your setup by debugging a simple project.

- **Fork** the [starter code repository](https://github.com/ashx3s/sd-web-2-a1-code) and then **clone** your forked version to your computer.
- Fix all logic and syntax errors in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - The browser console must be free of errors.
  - The HTML must pass the [W3C validator test](https://validator.w3.org/).
  - The CSS must be responsive and use an accessible color scheme.
- Organize all static assets (e.g., images from the broken project) into the asset directory you created in Part 1.
- In `README.md`, briefly explain the difference between **forking**, **cloning**, and **downloading** a repository.
- Add a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules` in it.
  - _Most frameworks generate this file, but it's important to understand its purpose._

## Part 3: Assignment Submission

Submit the following to the Week 1 assignment page in Brightspace.

- A link to your **GitHub repository** in the submission comment.
- A link to your live **GitHub Pages site**, also in the submission comment.

## Rubric: 15 points (5% of final grade)

### Code Quality (HTML/CSS) /5

- **HTML:** Semantic tags are used, and the code passes W3C validation.
- **CSS:** The design is responsive, uses accessible colors, and demonstrates a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Bug Fixes:** Errors in the HTML and CSS files are effectively corrected.

### JavaScript /5

- **Functionality:** All JavaScript logic and syntax errors are fixed.
- **Conventions:** Code uses clear variable names, follows standard casing, and is well-formatted.
- **Console:** The browser console is free of any errors or warnings.

### Code Management /5

- **Git Commits:** At least two commits with meaningful, descriptive messages are present.
- **Documentation:** README terminology notes are clear and correct.
- **Organization:** The Node.js screenshot and all other static assets are correctly placed in a dedicated asset folder.
