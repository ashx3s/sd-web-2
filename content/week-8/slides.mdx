# CPRG-306 Week 8

# Fetching Data

---

## Agenda

1. HTTP: Methods, Status Codes
2. JS: Promises, Async/Await, and Fetch API
3. React: `useEffect` Hook
4. Coding Demo

---

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

- Application layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents
- Used to request and send data over the internet
- Stateless: Each request is independent of the others
- Client-server model: Client sends requests, server sends responses

---

## HTTP, cont'd

- REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications
- RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations
- JSON is a common data format used in RESTful APIs

---

## HTTP Request Methods

- `GET`: Retrieve data
- `POST`: Create new data
- `PUT`: Update existing data
- `PATCH`: Partial update
- `DELETE`: Remove data

---

## HTTP Request Example

Browser sends a `GET` request (`https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week-8`) to fetch data from a server

```http
GET /week-8 HTTP/2
Host: webdev2.warsylewicz.ca
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:131.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/131.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/png,image/svg+xml,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd
Referer: https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week-8
...
```

---

## HTTP Response

- Server sends a response back to the client
- Contains the requested data and metadata
- Status code indicates the success or failure of the request
- Headers provide additional information about the response
- Body contains the data, e.g. HTML content, JSON data

---

## HTTP Status Codes

- 1xx: Informational
- 2xx: Success
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client Error
- 5xx: Server Error

---

## Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Request was successful
- `201 Created`: Resource was created
- `204 No Content`: Request was successful, no content to return
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

---

## HTTP Response Example

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: *
age: 167807
cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate
content-disposition: inline; filename="fetching-data"
content-encoding: br
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
...
```

---

## JS Promises

- A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous (non-blocking) operation
- Three states: pending, fulfilled, rejected
- Pending -> Fulfilled (`.then`) or Rejected (`.catch`)
- Callback functions are passed to `.then` and `.catch`
- Promises are chainable and can be used to handle multiple asynchronous operations

---

## JS Async/Await

- Instead of using `.then` and `.catch`, we can use `async` and `await` to handle promises
- `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function
- `await` keyword is used to "pause" the execution of the function until the promise is resolved
- `try` and `catch` blocks can be used to handle errors
- Much cleaner and easier to read than using `.then` and `.catch`

---

## Notation Comparison

```javascript
// Using .then and .catch
fetch("https://api.example.com/data") // Fetching data returns a promise
  .then((response) => response.json()) // When the fetch promise is resolved, prarsing the JSON returns another promise
  .then((data) => console.log(data)) // When the parsing promise is resolved, logs the data
  .catch((error) => console.error(error)); // If there is an error, logs the error

// Using async/await
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data"); // Pauses here until the promise is resolved returning the response.
    const data = await response.json(); // Pauses here until the promise is resolved returning the data.
    console.log(data); // Does not pause here.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

---

## Fetch API

- Provides a way to make HTTP requests and handle responses
- Returns a promise which when resolved, returns the response to the request
- Can be used to fetch data from an API, send data to a server, etc.

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
const data = await response.json(); // or response.text(), etc.
```

---

### React `useEffect` Hook

- Used to perform side effects in functional components
- A side effect is any code that affects something outside the scope of the component
- Side effects include data fetching, timers, manual DOM manipulation
- Runs after every render by default
- Can be used to run code only when certain values change

---

## `useEffect` Syntax

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run
}, [dependencies]);
```

- The function passed to `useEffect` is the effect
- The second argument is an array of dependencies
- If the dependencies change, the effect will run again
- If the dependencies are empty, the effect will only run once
- If the dependencies are omitted, the effect will run after every render. **This is not recommended.**

---

## Coding Demo

- Use [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
- When the page loads, display a random image of a dog
- Display the list of breeds in a dropdown
- When a breed is selected, display a random image of that breed
