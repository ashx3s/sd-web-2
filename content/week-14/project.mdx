# Project Phase 3: Complete Project and Self-reflection

## Finish Coding

This is your final opportunity to finalize your application, address any remaining issues, and ensure that all features are working as expected.

By the end of this sprint, you should have a fully functional, deployed version of your application. Remember, all changes should be pushed to your GitHub repository. This final deployment should represent a polished, user-ready version of your application.

## Self-reflection

As the final phase of your project, I want you to reflect on your project journey. This is an opportunity for you to evaluate how you managed the project, what you've learned, what went well, and what didn't.

This self-reflection is not just an exercise in introspection but also a chance for you to assign your own grade for this project phase, which will account for 40% of the final grade of the course.

Remember, the aim of self-reflection is not to judge yourself harshly, but to honestly evaluate your performance and identify areas for improvement. This reflection will help you understand your strengths and areas of interest better as a developer. It may guide you in deciding whether you wish to continue with web development and if you prefer
front-end, back-end, or full-stack development. This introspective process is crucial for your growth and future direction in the field.
