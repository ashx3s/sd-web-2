# Week 6 Assignment

## Overview

This week's assignment adds sorting functionality to the shopping list application. The source of the items will be from a JSON file, demonstrating how to load and use static data.

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

## Part 1: Initial Setup

<Steps>

### Link to the Week 6 Page

Edit the project file `/app/page.js` and add a link to `week-6` in the list of links.

### Create the Folder and Files

Create the folder `/app/week-6` and the files `page.js`, `item-list.js`, and `item.js` inside it. If you completed the Week 3 Assignment, you can copy the files from that assignment into this folder.

### `items.json`

Create a file called `items.json` in the `/app/week-6` folder. This file contains the data for the shopping list. It is an array of objects, where each object represents an item in the list.

Copy the following data into the file:

```json copy
[
  {
    "id": "1h2GJKH12gkHG31h1H",
    "name": "milk, 4 L ü•õ",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "dairy"
  },
  {
    "id": "2KJH3k2j3H1k2J3K1H",
    "name": "bread üçû",
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "bakery"
  },
  {
    "id": "3h2KJH3k2j3H1k2J3",
    "name": "eggs, dozen ü•ö",
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "dairy"
  },
  {
    "id": "4k2J3K1H2GJKH12gk",
    "name": "bananas üçå",
    "quantity": 6,
    "category": "produce"
  },
  {
    "id": "5H1h1H2KJH3k2j3H",
    "name": "broccoli ü•¶",
    "quantity": 3,
    "category": "produce"
  },
  {
    "id": "6H1k2J3K1H2GJKH1",
    "name": "chicken breasts, 1 kg üçó",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "meat"
  },
  {
    "id": "7gkHG31h1H2KJH3k",
    "name": "pasta sauce üçù",
    "quantity": 3,
    "category": "canned goods"
  },
  {
    "id": "8j3H1k2J3K1H2GJK",
    "name": "spaghetti, 454 g üçù",
    "quantity": 2,
    "category": "dry goods"
  },
  {
    "id": "9H12gkHG31h1H2KJ",
    "name": "toilet paper, 12 pack üßª",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "household"
  },
  {
    "id": "10H3k2j3H1k2J3K1",
    "name": "paper towels, 6 pack",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "household"
  },
  {
    "id": "11k2J3K1H2GJKH12",
    "name": "dish soap üçΩÔ∏è",
    "quantity": 1,
    "category": "household"
  },
  {
    "id": "12GJKH12gkHG31h1",
    "name": "hand soap üßº",
    "quantity": 4,
    "category": "household"
  }
]
```

### Build the `Item` Component

No change from the Week 3 Assignment.

> In `item.js`, create a functional component named `Item`. This component should accept `name`, `quantity`, and `category` as props and display them in a list item element.

### Build the `Page` Component

No change from the Week 3 Assignment.

> In `page.js`, create a functional component named `Page` that returns a `main` element wrapped around an `h1` "Shopping List" header and the `ItemList` component.

</Steps>

## Part 2: Build the `ItemList` Component

<Steps>

### Setup ItemList Component

Remove all item variables (`const item1` etc.) from the `ItemList` component.

Import the useState hook from React, the Item component, and the items from the JSON file.

### Initialize State Variable

- Use the `useState` hook to create a state variable `sortBy` and its setter function `setSortBy`. This will be used to determine the sorting preference of the user.
- Set the initial value of sortBy to `"name"`, indicating that the list should initially be sorted by name.

### Sort the Items

- Use JavaScript's sort function to sort the items array based on the `sortBy` state variable.
- If sortBy is `"name"`, sort the items by their name property.
- If sortBy is `"category"`, sort the items by their category property.

### Create Sort Buttons

- Create two buttons that allow the user to change the value of sortBy to `"name"` or `"category"`. These buttons should change the sorting of the items when clicked.
- Use the `setSortBy` function in the `onClick` event handlers of these buttons to change the value of `sortBy`.
- Use conditional rendering to change the background color of the buttons based on the current value of `sortBy`. This gives the user a visual indication of what the current sorting preference is.

### Render the Items

Use the `map` function to create a new `Item` component for each item in the items array. Don't forget to provide a unique key prop for each `Item` (you can use the item's id for this purpose).

</Steps>

### Optional Extra Challenge

Add a third button to the page that groups the list by category. The categories and items for each category are sorted alphabetically. Hints: use the JS `reduce` method and Tailwind CSS `capitalize`.

For example:

<div className="border p-3">
**Bakery**
- bread üçû

**Canned Goods**

- pasta sauce üçù

**Dairy**

- eggs, dozen ü•ö
- milk, 4 L ü•õ

etc.

</div>
