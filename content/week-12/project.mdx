# Project Phase 2: Project Setup

Welcome to Phase 2 in your project! This week, you'll begin to see your planning from Phase 1 materialize into a working application.

## Project Setup: Next.js, GitHub, and Vercel

It's time to set up your development environment. This process involves creating a Next.js project, establishing a GitHub repository, and optionally deploying your application via Vercel. You may find it helpful to review the following guides:

- [Guide: How to Create a New Next.js Project](/guides-and-references/creating-new-nextjs-project)
- [Guide: Deploying a Next.js App using Vercel](/guides-and-references/deploying-nextjs-app)

If you're working in a group, add all group members as collaborators to your GitHub repository. You can do this by navigating to the repository settings on GitHub, selecting "Collaborators", and adding your group members' GitHub usernames.

### Continuous Integration/Deployment

I highly encourage you to adopt a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow. This means that every change you push to your GitHub repository will automatically be deployed to Vercel, keeping your live application up-to-date with your latest changes. Each sprint in your project development process should result in a successful deployment. This ensures that you maintain a working version of your application at all times, allowing you to catch and address issues early.
