# CPRG-306 Week 9

# Firebase Auth

---

## Agenda

1. Authentication vs Authorization
2. Firebase: Auth
3. React: `children` prop, Context API, Custom Hooks
4. Next.js: Environment Variables
5. Coding Demo

---

## Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user
- **Authorization**: Verifying what a user has access to
- **Firebase Auth**: Service that provides authentication for web, mobile, and desktop applications
- **OAuth**: Open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords

## `children` Prop

- A special prop that can be used to pass components as data to other components

```
function Parent({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Parent>
      <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </Parent>
  );
}
```

---

## React Context

- A way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level avoiding prop drilling
- A global state that can be accessed from any component (e.g. user info, language, theme)
- A context is an object that stores a value and can be accessed by any child component
- It's like a global variable that can be accessed from any sub-component
- It's like `props` but without having to pass them down manually

---

## React Context API

- `createContext`: a function that creates a new context
- `Context.Provider`: a component that passes the context to its children
- `useContext`: a hook that uses the context

- Example: https://github.com/warsylewicz/webdev2-demos/tree/master/app/week-9-context

---

## Custom Hooks

- A way to share logic between components
- A JavaScript function whose name starts with `use`
- Can call other hooks if needed
- Can be used to create reusable logic

---

## Custom Hooks Example

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

export function useCounter(initialValue) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return { count, increment, decrement };
}
```

`useCounter` is a custom hook that returns an object with `count`, `increment`, and `decrement` properties.

---

## Custom Hooks Example, cont'd

```javascript
import { useCounter } from "./useCounter";

export default function Page() {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

`useCounter` is used to manage the state of a counter.

---

## Environment Variables

- A way to store sensitive configuration settings for an application
- Not hard-coded in the source code
- Not stored in the version control system (e.g. Git)
- Must be copied to deployment environment (Vercel)
- e.g. API keys, database connection strings, passwords

---

## Environment Variables Example

- `.env.local` file in the root of the project
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_...` prefix is required for client-side code

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSyDd7f7...";
```

---

## Coding Demo

- Following most of the steps from the assignment, implement a simple web application from scratch with authentication
