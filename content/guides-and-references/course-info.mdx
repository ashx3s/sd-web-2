- **Classmates:** Your classmates are a great resource. Remember that everyone is learning and someone might have a different perspective or have overcome the exact challenge you're facing. Be open to collaborating and helping each other out.

- **Instructor:** I'm here to guide you through your learning journey. During class, don't hesitate to ask questions, whether they're about the course content or broader concepts.

### Outside of Class

- **Classmates:** Even outside of class hours, consider setting up study groups or chat sessions with your classmates. This not only helps clarify concepts, but it also builds a community of learners.

- **AI Tools:** AI tools like GitHub Copilot, chat-based AI tools, or AI-driven documentation tools can be great for troubleshooting code problems, understanding new concepts, or providing new perspectives.

- **SAIT Tutor:** If you're stuck on a concept or need additional help outside of class time, SAIT provides free tutoring services. Make sure to use this resource if you're feeling overwhelmed or need extra help understanding a concept.

Always remember, struggling is a normal part of the learning process, so don't be shy about reaching out for help.

## AI Assisted Tools

As future web developers, it's essential to stay current with emerging technologies that can aid and streamline your development process. In this course, I encourage the use of AI assisted tools like Phind and GitHub Copilot.

### Chat-based Tools

These chat-based AI tools can be extremely helpful in various stages of your learning journey. From brainstorming ideas to troubleshooting code, they can provide insightful assistance in understanding and applying the topics covered in the course.

However, it's important to remember that these AI models are tools to aid your development process, not replacements for your own critical thinking and creativity. While they can provide you with a spectrum of answers or solutions, it's crucial that you evaluate the appropriateness of those responses in the context of your specific project or problem.

Using these tools effectively involves leveraging their capabilities to enhance your learning and development processes, while also being critical and mindful of their limitations. Always ensure you understand the code and concepts you're working with, using AI tools as supplementary support rather than complete solutions. This approach will help strengthen your coding skills and enable you to write better, more effective code.

Where available, try to use the most advanced version of the AI model, currently gpt-4. The more advanced the model, the more accurate and relevant the responses will be.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant. It can be a powerful tool to help you write code more efficiently. It suggests code snippets as you type, based on the patterns it learned from millions of open-source projects. It can be incredibly useful for learning syntax, discovering new methods, and reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks.

However, remember that it's important to understand the code you're writing. Don't rely solely on GitHub Copilot to write code for you. Instead, use it as a learning tool. When Copilot suggests a solution, take the time to understand how and why it works. This will strengthen your coding skills and enable you to write better code, with or without the assistance of AI tools.

Remember, these AI-assisted tools are meant to enhance your learning experience and not to replace the fundamental understanding and application of the knowledge you gain. Make the most of these tools but also be mindful and critical of their limitations.

### Specific Use Cases for AI Tools

Here are some specific use cases where AI-assisted tools can be used effectively for learning in this course:

1. **Writing new code:** When creating new code, you can use tools like GitHub Copilot to assist you, but it's crucial to ensure you understand the code it generates. If you don't, use the AI tool to help explain it. A good prompt could be:

> I am a beginner learning web development using Next.js, React, and Tailwind. I am currently learning form interactivity in React. Can you help me write a function that validates an email input field in React?

And then a good follow-up prompt could be:

> I understand that the code you suggested is [explain what you understand]. Can you explain why [explain what you don't understand]?

Or:

> The code you gave me doesn't work because [explain why it doesn't work]. Can you help me fix it?

In addition, when GitHub Copilot suggests multiple solutions, try to understand the differences between them and select the most appropriate one for your project.

2. **Debugging:** When you encounter a bug, first attempt to resolve it yourself. Give yourself a few minutes to analyze and understand the issue. If that doesn't work, you can share your code block with an AI tool. A good prompt could be:

> I am a beginner learning web development using Next.js, React, and Tailwind. I have encountered a bug [where?, provide context about where you have the bug, e.g. in a React function]. [Provide lots more context: include the error message, what the expected behaviour is, what the buggy behaviour is, possibly include the assignment description.] [Now what do you want? e.g. Give me a hint where the bug may be, tell me what the bug is but don't solve it, or solve the bug and explain why the bug exists.]

3. **Concept understanding:** If a particular concept seems difficult, don't hesitate to ask the AI tool for alternative explanations. A useful prompt could be:

> I am a beginner learning web development using Next.js, React, and Tailwind. I am currently trying to understand [topic, e.g. React hooks]. I know that [explain what you think you know], but I'm not sure why [explain your uncertainty]. [What do you want? e.g. help me understand this better at my level, give me an example that I would understand, or give me a link to a resource that explains this better.]

4. **Additional examples:** AI tools can provide numerous examples on demand. If you want more practice or exposure to a specific concept, simply ask the AI tool for more examples. A good prompt could be:

> I am a beginner learning web development using Next.js, React, and Tailwind. I would like to see two examples with explanations on [topic, e.g. JavaScript promises].

5. **Translation:** If English is not your first language, AI-powered translation tools can be invaluable for translating code and documentation. This can help you understand the material more effectively and efficiently. Remember, however, that coding globally is primarily conducted in English. Over time, becoming comfortable with English coding terminology will enhance your ability to participate fully in the global coding community.
