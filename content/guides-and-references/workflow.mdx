# Guide: Coding Workflow

The guide is designed to help students streamline their coding process, ensure their code is safely versioned with Git, and keep their work synced on GitHub.

<Steps>

### Opening Your Project

Open Visual Studio Code.

In VS Code, go to File -> Open... and select the folder of your existing project.

### Start the Development Server

Open the terminal in VS Code by going to View -> Terminal or by pressing Ctrl-`

In the terminal, run the command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. Your application will typically be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### Coding and Seeing Changes

Make the desired changes to your code.

As you save your changes, the development server will automatically refresh your application. You can view these changes by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

### Committing and Pushing Changes to GitHub

**Review Your Changes**

Open GitHub Desktop. It should automatically detect the changes in your project. You can review these changes by selecting your repository and clicking on the "Changes" tab.

**Commit Your Changes**

In the lower left corner of the GitHub Desktop window, you'll find a summary field and a description field. Enter a brief summary of your changes in the summary field. If you want to provide a more detailed description, you can enter that in the description field. Then, click the "Commit to main" button.

**Push Your Changes to GitHub**

After you've committed your changes, click the "Push origin" button at the top of the GitHub Desktop window. This will upload your committed changes to GitHub.

  It is highly recommended to have a quick look at your code on GitHub to make
  sure everything looks good. You can do this by navigating to your repository
  on GitHub. You can also view your commit history by clicking on the "Commits"
  links.

  Always remember to commit frequently and write clear, descriptive commit
  messages. Your code backup is only as good as your last commit and push!

### Shutting Down

Stop the Development Server: When you're done coding, you should shut down the development server. In the terminal, press Ctrl-c to stop it.

Close VS Code

Remember, this is a cycle: the next time you come back to code, you'll start at Step 1 again. Happy coding!
