# Project Phase 2: Build Features

This week, you'll continue to build on the work you started last week. You should be making progress on your project, implementing features, and working towards your project goals.

## Commit Recommendations

Every member of your group (or you, if working individually) should make at least one commit to the project repository during this sprint Remember, each commit should reflect a meaningful change or addition to your project; try to avoid "empty" commits that don't contribute to the progress of the project.

## Deployment

By the end of this sprint, you should have a successfully deployed version of your application. This means that all the changes you've made during this sprint should be pushed to your GitHub repository and automatically deployed to Vercel. Remember, maintaining a working, deployed application throughout your project helps you test and debug in a real-world environment and keeps your project on track.

## Sprint Goals

During this sprint, you should aim to stick to the plan and milestones you defined during Phase 1. This includes working on the specific features, functionality, or sections of your application that you identified for this period.

Remember, the aim of this sprint is to start transforming your project plan into a tangible, working application.
