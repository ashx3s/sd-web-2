# CPRG-306 Week 12

# API Implementation

---

- API routes
  - `/api/...`

---

## RESTful APIs

- Representational State Transfer (REST)
- RESTful APIs
  - Use HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations
  - Use URLs to represent resources
  - Use status codes to indicate success or failure

---

## HTTP Methods

- GET: Retrieve data
- POST: Create new data
- PUT: Update existing data
- PATCH: Partially update existing data
- DELETE: Delete data

---

## Resources and URLs

- Resources are represented by URLs
- URLs are hierarchical
- URLs can represent collections and individual items
- e.g. `/api/users/123` represents user with id `123`
- e.g. `/api/users` represents all users
- e.g. `/api/users/123/orders/777` represents order id 777 for user with id 123

---

## Examples

- GET `/api/users/123` will return user object with id `123`
- POST `/api/users` with request body will create a new user
- PUT `/api/users/123` with request body will update user
- DELETE `/api/users/123` will delete user with id `123`

---

## API Implementation

- In Next.js API routes are implemented using `route.js` files in any folder, usually in an `api` folder
- API routes are server-side code only

---

## Demo: 3 Parts

- Part 1
  - Simple API (GET only)
- Part 2
  - API with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods for /api/dogs and /api/dogs/:id
- Part 3
  - Validation of request body

---

## Demo: For Each Part

- API implementation with route.js
- Test the API using VS Code extension REST Client
- Consume the API from the front-end using `fetch`
